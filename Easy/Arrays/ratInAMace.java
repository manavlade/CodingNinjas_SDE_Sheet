     * Question
     * You are given a starting position for a rat which is stuck in a maze at an
     * initial point (0, 0) (the maze can be thought of as a 2-dimensional plane).
     * The maze would be given in the form of a square matrix of order 'N' * 'N'
     * where the cells with value 0 represent the mazeâ€™s blocked locations while
     * value 1 is the open/available path that the rat can take to reach its
     * destination. The rat's destination is at ('N' - 1, 'N' - 1). Your task is to
     * find all the possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to
     * destination in the maze. The possible directions that it can take to move in
     * the maze are 'U'(up) i.e. (x, y - 1) , 'D'(down) i.e. (x, y + 1) , 'L' (left)
     * i.e. (x - 1, y), 'R' (right) i.e. (x + 1, y).
     * 
     * Note:
     * Here, sorted paths mean that the expected output should be in alphabetical
     * order.
     * For Example:
     * Given a square matrix of size 4*4 (i.e. here 'N' = 4):
     * 1 0 0 0
     * 1 1 0 0
     * 1 1 0 0
     * 0 1 1 1
     * Expected Output:
     * DDRDRR DRDDRR
     * i.e. Path-1: DDRDRR and Path-2: DRDDRR
     * 
     * The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths, i.e.
     * DRDDRR and DDRDRR when printed in sorted order, we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.
