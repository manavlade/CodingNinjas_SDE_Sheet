     * Question
     * Write a program to implement a Stack using Array. Your task is to use the
     * class as shown in the comments in the code editor and complete the functions
     * push() and pop() to implement a stack. The push() method takes one argument,
     * an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack and pop() which returns an integer
     * present at the top and popped out from the stack. If the stack is empty then
     * return -1 from the pop() method.
     * 
     * Note: The input is given in form of queries. Since there are two operations
     * push() and pop(), there is two types of queries as described below:
     * (i) 1 x (a query of this type means pushing 'x' into the stack)
     * (ii) 2 (a query of this type means to pop an element from the stack and print
     * the popped element)
     * Input contains separated by space and as described above.
