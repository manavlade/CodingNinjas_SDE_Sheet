     * Question
     * You are given an array 'ARR' of 'N' positive integers. Your task is to find
     * if we can partition the given array into two subsets such that the sum of
     * elements in both subsets is equal.
     * 
     * For example, letâ€™s say the given array is [2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5], then the array
     * can be partitioned as [2, 3, 5], and [3, 3, 4] with equal sum 10.
     * 
     * Follow Up:
     * 
     * Can you solve this using not more than O(S) extra space, where S is the sum
     * of all elements of the given array?
